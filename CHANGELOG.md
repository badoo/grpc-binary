# 1.50.2
- Specific to this repo, the `Resources` directory from the `gRPC-C++.zip`'s
  underlying `xcframework` was removed. Otherwise, `1.50.2` matches `1.50.1`.
  This fixes [firebase-ios-sdk/#11401](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues/11401).

# 1.50.1
- Update binaries to be in sync with source-of-truth gRPC 1.50.1 release.

# 1.44.0
- Update binaries to be in sync with source-of-truth gRPC 1.44.0 release.
